    "The Graph Isomorphism problem can spot whether two graphs are the same graph in diguise. Most computer problems fall into one of two categories. <b>\"Easy problems\"</b> can be solved in a polynomial number of steps, if the number of steps grows as n <i>to the power of</i> 2 or n <i>to the power of</i> 3. These problems can usually be solved efficiently on a computer. <b>\"Hard problems\"</b>, best known algorithms take an exponential (such as 2 <i>to the power of</i> n) number of steps. This is far too many steps for a computer to carry out efficiently. Only a handful of natural problems, including graph isomorphism, seem to defy this dichotomy. Computer scientists have struggled for decades to figure out just where graph isomorphism belongs. [1]"
