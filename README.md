# GraphTheoryAssessment

## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to display my understanding and learning outcomes of the module "Graph Theory". 

Within the contents of this repository you will find two notebooks:
- Heap Sort Notebook
- Graph Isomorphism Problem Notebook

Within the Heap Sort Notebook I have discussed the implementation of heap sort through python, the computational complexity of heap sort and why graph theory is important in heap sort. I have explained my understanding of the Heap Sort alogorithm. 

For the Graph Isomorphism Problem Notebook, you will find how graphs can be represented in a data structure, python functioning which shows how to determine if two graphs are isomorphic. I have also explains the graph isomorphism problem. 

I have used python to create these notebooks through a package called Jupyter. By using this I have learnt a lot about Jupyter and also improved my knowledge of python. 

I would like to take this opertunity to thank you for reading my notebooks and I hope that you enjoy while also learning.
